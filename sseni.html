      In 2023, Vincent Meyrick was awarded the George Alexander Fellowship by the
International Specialised Skills Institute to further their studies around knitwear and
fashion design. They interned Sato Seni, one of Japan’s largest and most
established knitwear companies, based in the northern Yamagata prefecture. They
trained in Japan for six months. Working closely with friend and mentor Tesshun
Sato, they immersed themselves in the Japanese language and way of life. During
their internship, they became familiar with the hands-on practices, programming and
engineering required to produce knitwear from start to finish. They not only learnt
about knitwear techniques, but about the cultural landscape textiles came from. They
documented this process to better understand how to re-vitalise Australia’s own
textile manufacturing industry. <br><br>
The photographs below were taken mostly in a small town called Sagae in
Yamagata. They are a chronology of the different stages of manufacturing knitwear
and yarn: from wool preparation, wool spinning, yarn winding and twisting, and
dyeing, through to different knitting processes, sewing, pattern making, cutting,
steaming, product checking and packaging.<br><br>

After their internship, Vincent travelled around Japan, visiting the denim mills and
jean factories of Okayama, and working as a styling assistant at Vogue in Tokyo.
