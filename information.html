Vincent Meyrick, the founder of the label Vincent Fabrications, is an emerging
designer, tailor and knitwear technician from Melbourne, Australia. Vincent grew up
in theatres, around creative arts practitioners and performers. Their father is a
theatre director and their mother is a period costume designer. Theatricality lies at
the heart of their work. In the past, they have produced collections based around the
intersection of old-world tailoring and contemporary workwear.
After training in the knitwear factories of northern Japan in 2022 to better understand
textile production, Vincent has returned to Melbourne to continue their work as a
designer. Their select offerings and collections reflect ideas of utility and formal
dress.<br><br>
Vincent Fabrications operates on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin
nation in so-called ‘Australia’. We acknowledge the traditional custodians of these
lands and pay our respects to their elder’s past, present, and emerging. We
recognise that sovereignty was never ceded.
