      Vincent Fabrications presents Book Bags, other old stuff, a select range of
creations formed out of necessity.
Vincent Fabrications as a label explores
flamboyant and archaic utility. Here, Vincent explores their own version of “the bare
minimum”. How can garments be theatrical and foppish for fun and extravagance yet
also everyday equipment and items?<br><br>
The Book Bag. Soiled waxed tent canvas is meticulously reworked to create large
bags that are as much of a garment as they are a bag. They are out-size heavy-duty
sacks made for holding large heavy books, shopping or lead piping. Their wide
quilted strapping evenly distributes all weight across your shoulders and chest.
Each bag brought into existence shares a centre front felled seam, fine Japanese
brass rivets, large reinforcing stiches and inside pockets for gather all kinds of
miscellaneous junk. The Book Bag comes in two colours beige and brownish grey.
The bags avoid any clear fashion aesthetic and are a versatile pairing to a wide
range of accompanying outfits. Through these Bags, Vincent Fabrications captures
the “here and now” of a newly-emerging Melbourne while also creating an artefact
that has durability and longevity.<br><br>
After visiting Japan’s denim capital, Okayama, in 2021, Vincent got the chance to
see how the sausage gets made by some of Japan’s best denim weavers and jean
makers. After returning with two hundred metres of Selvedge denim, the Vincent
Fabrications jean was made, drawing inspiration from the long-legged Levi’s worn
by cowboys in the America’s West.
