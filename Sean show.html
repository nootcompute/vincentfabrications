      In December 2022, Vincent Meyrick created their first independent fashion collection
of over twenty separately-designed and handmade items. This collection was
presented in a self-produced fashion show in collaboration with two other fashion
designers, Grace Dinham and Jasmine Featherston (Feath). Titled Closet Collection,
the group collaboration brought together shoemaking, knitting, and tailoring in a
theatrical and extravagant catwalk, in which models walked out in their underwear
and dressed into their looks in front of a live audience.<br> After the runway, the pieces
were hung on the walls to give audiences the opportunity to inspect their finer
details. Taking place at APAX warehouse in Preston, the show was an authentically
collaborative community event. <br><br>The pictures below are by photographer and model,
Sean Monaghan.
