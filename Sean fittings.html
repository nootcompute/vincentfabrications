      In December 2022, Vincent Meyrick created their first independent fashion collection
of over twenty separately-designed and handmade items. This collection was
presented in a self-produced fashion show in collaboration with two other fashion
designers, Grace Dinham and Jasmine Featherston (Feath). Titled Closet Collection,
the group collaboration brought together shoemaking, knitting, and tailoring in a
theatrical and extravagant catwalk, in which models walked out in their underwear
and dressed into their looks in front of a live audience.<br><br> Before the runway, fittings were held at a studio in the Nicholas Building. 
<br><br>The pictures below are by photographer and model,
Sean Monaghan.
