<h1 class="h1">Product name: BOOK BAG + Bread clip by Tyke Rashid </h1>

<d class="d">Soiled waxed tent canvas is meticulously reworked to create large bags that are as much of a garment as they are a bag. 
They are gargantuan heavy-duty sacks made for cramming large heavy books, shopping, or lead piping into. Their wide quilted strapping evenly distributes any weight across your shoulders and chest. 
Each bag toiled into existence sharing a centre front felled seam, fine Japanese brass rivets, large reinforcing stiches and inside pockets for gather all kinds of miscellaneous junk. 
The book bag comes in two colours beige and brownish grey. the bags fail to exist within any solid fashion aesthetic and a versatile pairing to a range of outfits. 
Through these bags Vincent Fabrications is able to capture what they think is the here and now of an upcoming Melbourne whilst simultaneously creating a garment that may have the same longevity as an artifact.
